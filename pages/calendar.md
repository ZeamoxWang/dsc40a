# ðŸ“† Calendar

Lectures and discussions are all held in Warren Lecture Hall (WLH) 2114 
- Check the calendar for the most updated locations and times of OHs. We will also make announcements, but this calendar is the source of truth.

Most office hours are held in person in the HalÄ±cÄ±oÄŸlu Data Science Institute. Office hours held remotely will have zoom links added to the OH location on this calendar.
